Table D.4. Statistical Modeling & Inference	Mass univariate analyses	Inference	Multiple testing correction 	Permutation or Monte Carlo	If permutation or Monte Carlo, report the number of permutations/samples. If Monte Carlo, note the brain mask and smoothness used, and how smoothness was estimated
Table D.5. Results Reporting	Mass univariate analysis	Effects tested			Provide a complete list of tested and omitted effects
Table D.5. Results Reporting	Mass univariate analysis	Extracted data			Define how voxels/elements were selected; if region is based on the same data, clarify how circularity was accounted for
Table D.5. Results Reporting	Mass univariate analysis	Extracted data			For any summary reported, give units. Ideally these are as interpretable as possible (e.g. percent change)
Table D.5. Results Reporting	Mass univariate analysis	Extracted data			If reporting R^2 (coefficient of determination) clarify how nuisance variability is considered. For instance, in task fMRI the vast majority of variance is explained by slow temporal drift, and R^2 values for an effect of interest will be vastly different if computed with or without counting drift in the total variance
Table D.5. Results Reporting	Mass univariate analysis	Extracted data			State whether data extracted from an ROI (e.g. to compute an effect size) is defined based on independent data, as otherwise it is susceptible to bias

Table D.5. Results Reporting	Mass univariate analysis	Tables of coordinates (one table)			In caption or body text, note criterion for peak per cluster reporting; e.g. “one peak per cluster listed”, or “up to 3 per cluster that are at least 8mm apart” (SPM default), etc.
