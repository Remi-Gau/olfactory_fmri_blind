The data acquisition was performed in the IUGM, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}},
Chemin Queen-Mary 4565,Montreal,District,CA,H3W 1W5.

MRI scans were acquired at 3 Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}} system
from SIEMENS, with serial number 167006. The software version was syngo MR E11.

### Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging data

#### T1-weighted image

MRI scans were acquired at 3 Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}} system
from SIEMENS, with serial number 167006. The software version was syngo MR E11.

{{PulseSequenceType}} GRIR SKSPMP T1w structural MRI data were collected (256
slices; repetition time, TR= 2.3 s; echo time, TE= 0.00226 s; flip angle, FA= 8
deg; field of view, FOV= 176 X 256 mm; matrix size= 176 X 256; voxel size= 1.00
X 1.00 X 1.00 mm).

### Task-Based Magnetic Resonance Imaging data

For the olfid task, 2 run(s) of bold {{PulseSequenceType}} EP SK fMRI data were
collected. The acquisition parameters were: 42 slices acquired in a interleaved
ascending fashion; repetition time, TR= 0.785 s; echo time, TE= 0.03 s; flip
angle, FA= 54 deg; field of view, FOV= 192 X 187 mm; matrix size= 64 X 64; voxel
size= 2.99 X 2.91 X 2.92 mm; multiband factor= 3. Each run was 4.5137 minutes in
length, during which 345 functional volumes were acquired.
