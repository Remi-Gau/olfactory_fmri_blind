### Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging data

#### T1-weighted image

The data acquisition was performed in the IUGM, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}}, 
Chemin Queen-Mary 4565,Montreal,District,CA,H3W 1W5.

MRI scans were acquired at 3 Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}} system from 
SIEMENS, with serial number 167006. The software version was syngo MR E11.

{{PulseSequenceType}} GRIR SKSPMP T1w structural MRI data were collected ({{nb_slices}} 
slices; repetition time, TR= 2.3 s; echo time, TE= 0.00226 s; flip angle, 
FA= 8 deg; field of view, FOV= {{fov}} mm; matrix size= {{mat_size}}; voxel size= 
{{vox_size}} mm).

#### T2-weighted image

The data acquisition was performed in the IUGM, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}}, 
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at {{MagneticFieldStrength}} Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}} 
system from SIEMENS, with serial number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}. The 
software version was {{SoftwareVersions}}.

{{PulseSequenceType}} SE SKSPOSP T2w structural MRI data were collected ({{nb_slices}} 
slices; repetition time, TR= 6.1 s; echo time, TE= 0.08 / 0.00 s; flip angle, 
FA= 150 deg; field of view, FOV= {{fov}} mm; matrix size= {{mat_size}}; voxel 
size= {{vox_size}} mm).
