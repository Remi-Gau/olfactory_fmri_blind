### Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging data

#### T1W data

The data acquisition was performed in the IUGM, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}}, 
Chemin Queen-Mary 4565,Montreal,District,CA,H3W 1W5.

MRI scans were acquired at 3 Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}} system from 
SIEMENS, with serial number 167006. The software version was syngo MR E11.

{{PulseSequenceType}} GRIR SKSPMP T1w structural MRI data were collected (256 slices; 
repetition time, TR= 2.3 s; echo time, TE= {{echo_time}} ms; flip angle, FA= 
8 deg; field of view, FOV= 175.69 X 255.55 mm; matrix size= 176 X 256; voxel 
size= 1.00 X 1.00 X 1.00 mm).

#### T2W data

The data acquisition was performed in the IUGM, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}}, 
{{InstitutionAddress}}.

MRI scans were acquired at {{MagneticFieldStrength}} Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}} 
system from SIEMENS, with serial number {{DeviceSerialNumber}}. The 
software version was {{SoftwareVersions}}.

{{PulseSequenceType}} SE SKSPOSP T2w structural MRI data were collected (29 slices; 
repetition time, TR= 6.1 s; echo time, TE= 0.08 / 0.00 ms; flip angle, FA= 150 
deg; field of view, FOV= 104.82 X 31.86 mm; matrix size= 672 X 896; voxel size=

### Task-Based Magnetic Resonance Imaging data

#### BOLD data

##### Task olfid data

The data acquisition was performed in the IUGM, {{InstitutionalDepartmentName}}, 
Chemin Queen-Mary 4565,Montreal,District,CA,H3W 1W5.

MRI scans were acquired at 3 Tesla using a {{ManufacturersModelName}} system from 
SIEMENS, with serial number 167006. The software version was syngo MR E11.

For the olfid task, 2 run(s) of bold {{PulseSequenceType}} EP SK fMRI data were 
collected. The acquisition parameters were: 42 slices acquired in a {{so_str}} fashion; 
repetition time, TR= 0.785 s; echo time, TE= {{echo_time}} ms; flip angle, 
FA= 54 deg; field of view, FOV= 191.64 X 186.53 mm; matrix size= 64 X 64; voxel 
size= 2.99 X 2.91 X 2.92 mm; multiband factor= {{mb_str}}; in-plane acceleration 
factor= {pr_str}}. Each run was 4.5137 minutes in length, during which 345 functional 
volumes were acquired.
