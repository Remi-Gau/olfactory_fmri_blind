    "details": "COBIDAS Appendix D reporting requirements grouped by 'aspect' in the original order presented as per https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/07/10/054262.  This document is intended to be used as a reference for researchers to record details of their own study against the recommendations of the COBIDAS report. It may also be modified for use in an appendix or supplementary material for the reporting of research methods.  The full COBIDAS Appendix D has been formatted to generate one row per recommendation. Each row has been given a unique six digit reference, to support collaborative communication about the details of the recommendations. The reference identifies (1) the table number, (2) aspect, (3) individual rows ('notes') within that aspect, (4) bullet points within a row (5) sub-bullet points and (6) the required detail. The column 'data source' is the suggested document which may be accessed to address the reporting requirement.  Rows are hidden to prevent disruption to the referencing formula. The workbook is shared without password protection. This document is not affiliated with or approved by COBIDAS.
